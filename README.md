Welcome to Yerbas 
===========================

 
Introduction
------------

WARNING! Yerbas is a work in progress...Use at your own risk!

Yerbas is a community driven, developmental, grassroots, digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. The Yerbas Coin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Yerbas is a code fork of Bitcoin/Dash/Ravencoin/Raptoreum and inherits current and optionally future features such as chain locks, oracles etc. The inspiration for the name Yerbas is derived from the Latin(herba) and Espa√±ol(hierba) words for herb, grass, or weeds.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/The-Yerbas-Endeavor/yerbas/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of Yerbas Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing.

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
